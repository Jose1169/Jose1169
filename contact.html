    <p> I have made my website fit on any screen for better usability. This allows anyone to view my website on any device screen. In the event, a video does not function, 
     or there is someone deaf there is alternative text available. I have added an alternative link for audio incase a browser does not support the audio format; the link takes the user to the original audio: youtube(it's music).
     The audio and video alterative allow for better accessibility.</p>
