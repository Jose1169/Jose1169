    <h1>Accessibility Discussion</h1>
    </br>
   <p> I have made my website fit on any screen for better usability.  In the event, a video does not function, 
     or there is someone deaf there is alternative text available. I have added an alternative link for audio in
     case a browser does not support the audio format; the link takes the user to the original audio on youtube(it's music).
     The audio and video alterative allow for better accessibility.</p>
