    <div id="accessibility-container"> 
      <p>I have made my website fit on any screen. This allows anyone to properly view my website on any device screen. There is a menu with hover color for better navigation. I have validated my CSS and HTML pages in World Wide Web Consortium validator. This means I have proper coding format. There are no style and contrast errors in my pages which allows for great usability.  In the event, a video does not function, or there is someone deaf there is alternative text available for my video. I have added an alternative link for audio in case a browser does not support the audio format. The link takes the user to the original audio: YouTube (it's an orchestral song). The audio and video alterative allow for better accessibility. </p>
